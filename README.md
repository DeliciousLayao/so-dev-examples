Developer docs code examples
===============

Some code examples for developer documentation.

Here we will demonstrate various developer related concepts.

>These examples are meant to demonstrate how a WordPress plugin developer may use the [SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle](https://wordpress.org/plugins/so-widgets-bundle/) plugin as a framework for creating widgets. As such, they do not function as an independent plugin, but rather as an extension of the Widgets Bundle plugin. That means the Widgets Bundle plugin must be installed and activated for these examples to work.

The so-dev-examples folder is just a container for what is intended to be a collection of individual example plugins. Currently, however, the collection consists of only one example plugin, namely, extend-widgets-bundle.

Inside so-dev-examples the folder named extend-widgets-bundle has the familiar plugin structure as put forth by WordPress [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#Names.2C_Files.2C_and_Locations). If you copy this folder into your plugins folder you should see the example widgets, assuming you have installed and activated the Widgets Bundle plugin.
